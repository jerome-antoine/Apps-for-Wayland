1. COMPOSITORS
   
   1.1. Stacking (or floating): Traditional behaviour of window managers, in the way of MS Windows or MacOS. Windows are like sheets of paper on a desk that can be stacked on top of each other.


   1.2. Tiling:
Windows are tiled so that none of them overlap. The use of key-bindings is generally extensive and there is little to no reliance on the mouse / touchpad. Tiling WM are either manual, either predefined with layouts, or both.


   1.3. Dynamic:
Window managers which can dynamically switch between stacking and tiling configurations.
